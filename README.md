Don’t let the poor little, adorable, space slime fall into the lava! Find his bed to win the day!!

Pong meets platformer, use WSAD or arrow keys to control the paddle and bounce your little slime along until you find the objective. Good luck!

Known Bugs: It’s really hard. Harder than I intended. More game play and tuning could really benefit it.
